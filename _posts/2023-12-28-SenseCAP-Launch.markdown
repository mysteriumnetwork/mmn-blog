## Launching the SenseCAP x MystNodes Partnership: Tap into Dual Crypto Passive Income

Mysterium continues to expand its growing network of partners, which are all helping to create a community-powered internet.

In that spirit, we are excited to announce our latest partnership with [SenseCAP](https://www.sensecapmx.com/), an IoT hardware brand with over 15 years of experience focusing on making high-quality hardware products and dApps accessible to the global Web 3.0 community.

MystNodes software has been integrated with [SenseCAP M4 Square](https://www.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAP-M4-p-5556.html?utm_source=MYST), a powerful device to run multiple Web 3.0 dAPPs ([Helium](https://www.helium.com/), [FluxNode](https://runonflux.io/nodes), and now [MystNodes](http://mystnodes.com)). This enables the community of miners to begin earning additional cryptocurrency with their existing devices.

Once set up, SenseCAP miners will become visible in the peer-to-peer VPN and proxy marketplace, turning an internet connection into an income stream, and joining a global community of 20,000+ all earning crypto passive income.

## SenseCAP License for Mysterium

Users will be charged a small amount of $1.99 USD/quarter or $6.99 USD per year  to get access to the MystNodes dashboard. With the purchased subscription, they will install the software and run it on their device.
