At the heart of Kryptex is its commitment to user convenience. Whether you're a crypto enthusiast looking to maximize your mining potential or a beginner curious about entering the world of cryptocurrencies, Kryptex's intuitive design ensures a hassle-free experience.

## What is Mysterium?  How will Mysterium benefit from this partnership? ##

Most of the internet you pay for goes to waste, sitting idle or completely unused. With the Kryptex x Mysterium integration, you can transform your internet connection into a valuable resource, earning crypto passive income while contributing to a more open web and optimizing internet infrastructure.

Using the Kryptex platform, you can easily join the Mysterium open marketplace to rent your IP address and help power and maintain the distributed network. Your PC becomes a network “node” so you can share your connection, providing anonymous decentralized VPN and proxy services to users or verified businesses around the world.

Kryptex has tens of thousands of active users, and their contribution to Mysterium will be incredibly valuable, helping the network become stronger and faster, providing more stable connections for end users and businesses.

Kryptex devices become an encrypted, secure access point to the internet so Mysterium’s partners can check out the web in your location for things like market research, price monitoring and search engine optimization. It’s also used by popular VPN apps that want to give their users a superior connection and local browsing experience.

## What is MYST token? ##

MYST is a utility token compatible with Ethereum and Polygon (L2) chains. Nodes earn the cryptocurrency $MYST based on the amount of bandwidth that is served through their device from connecting users or businesses in the network.
For convenience, Kyptex will convert the earned MYST into BTC and pay out its users directly into their accounts.
Mysterium has always been a huge advocate for an open internet. By allowing users to run nodes, Kryptex and Mysterium are merging the power of their community-driven, peer-to-peer networks.

Crypto miners and nodes are key players in the decentralized ecosystem, actively shaping the future of the web by contributing their internet resources in exchange for cryptocurrency.

As your PC works tirelessly in the background, Kryptex lets you effortlessly accumulate crypto rewards, opening doors to a new era of passive income in the ever-evolving realm of digital currencies.

4. Set a password for Mysterium.

   a. The password protects the web interface of the Mysterium node. The password must be reliable and should be different from your password on the mail and in Kryptex.
   
   b. You can reset password locally by deleting the file nodeui-pass from the **%UserProfile%\\.mysterium\\** folder.

5. Congratulations, you are now a node - an active participant in the Mysterium Network!

That’s it! You are now running a node and are a part of the vast Mysterium Network.

_Nb: not all countries will have access to Mysterium mining as the update is rolled out. Please contact Kryptex team for more information._

# Head to Kryptex Getting Started page <a href="https://www.kryptex.com/en/articles/mysterium-getting-started-en" style="color: blue" target="_blank">https://www.kryptex.com/en/articles/mysterium-getting-started-en</a>  to get all the information about mining MYST. #

# <span style="text-decoration:underline">Some Frequently Asked Questions</span> #

## Is MystNodes safe and private? ##
Absolutely. Node privacy is our priority. We only need the bare minimum information (your IP address) to get you online and earning. The network is secured by military-grade encryption and any traffic running through your device is encrypted. There is also no central database, so data cannot be physically collected or compromised.

## Can my node be used for illegal activities? How are users protected? ##
MystNodes offers the option to only accept verified traffic from our B2B partners who we vet and work with contractually. These businesses must use our services in accordance with their local laws. While we cannot say it’s 100% safe, it is incredibly rare and if anything illegal were to happen, our partners are required to take full responsibility for their own activities.

You can choose to accept only verified B2B partner traffic, and switch off “Public” and “VPN” traffic if you live in jurisdictions that have stricter regulations around torrenting, such as Germany. 

While we do as much as possible to protect nodes and prevent “bad” traffic, in reality most of the traffic is safe. The vast majority of traffic passing through exit nodes is legal and legitimate. Additionally, all connections are secured and any traffic running through your node is encrypted.

It's also worth noting that our network is not designed to facilitate illegal activity, and the vast majority of users are law-abiding individuals who are simply seeking greater online access, privacy and security online. In fact, many journalists, activists, and researchers rely on such networks to protect their online communications and research from surveillance.

## Certain locations and our recommendations ##

* Don’t enable “Public” traffic if you’re based in the following countries: Canada, U.S., UK, Italy, Australia, Germany or India.
* For those who have a greater technological understanding of how to run an exit node safely and protect the privacy of their node running activities from ISPs, you are welcome to accept all “public” and “VPN” traffic. [Please read our guide on running an exit node](https://dvpnalliance.org/exit-node/).
* In certain countries you should not encounter issues by running a node, as their laws are much more relaxed. If you accept “public” traffic, you increase your risk factor but with it, significantly increase your earning potential.

**_Please make sure you’re up to date with the regulations in your country._**

## How do I earn crypto? ##
The process of earning crypto by selling your internet connection is sometimes called bandwidth mining or crypto mining. You will accumulate MYST every time a business connects to your node. Your MYST earnings will be automatically converted into BTC and paid out by Kryptex.

Your earnings are measured by the amount of traffic (Gigabytes) that flows through your device. Your earnings are also impacted by the location of your IP address and how stable your connection is.

Some IPs are more in demand based on their region, however there is interest from VPN users (travelers, expats) and businesses for IP addresses from all over the world. It’s best to leave your node running 24/7, with a strong connection, to maximize your potential earnings. 

## Will running a MystNode affect my internet?  ##
Running a node should have very little impact on your home internet. While you may notice from time to time that your internet is slower, it’s unlikely that any speed downgrade will be noticeable.

If it is, you can always check your dashboard to see if there are any active sessions that may be affecting your connection. The tradeoff in speed may be that you are currently earning crypto!
